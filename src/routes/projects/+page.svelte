		<h1>Project Concepts</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><h2>Unbiased Political Information</h2></li>
			<p>
				This idea revolves around getting data directly from the <a href="https://gpo.congress.gov/">congress API</a> to report on policy without the bias of any corporation. This 
				project would make reading the primary source of our congressional hearings as simple as possible. This project involves summarizing
				information from those hearings and presenting them in an easily digestable format.
